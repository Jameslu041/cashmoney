# FedCash ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

FedCash is a fully decentralized fractional reserve cryptocurrency. No pre-mine, no dev-fund, no investors.

All the code is open-sourced on our github (https://github.com/Fed-Cash).

In the FedCash kingdom, FedCash is the stablecoin. FedShare is the algorithmic token.

To mint 1 FedCash, a user must deposit $1 in value, split between stablecoin collateral and FedShare. The ratio of each is determined by the global reserve ratio.

For example, if the reserve ratio is 75%, 1 FedCash required $0.75 stablecoin and $0.25 FedShare.

The reserve ratio is decreased by 0.5% if FedCash is trading above $1 every 8 hours. The reserve ratio is increased by 0.5% if FedCash is trading below $1 every 8 hours.
